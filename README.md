Proposed working project title:

Integrating Google Trends data and socioeconomic indicators to accurately forecast State-Level Mental Health Service Utilization for the upcoming year.


Brief background: 

Access to mental health services remains a significant public health concern in the United States. Despite the increasing demand for mental health care in recent years, disparities in access and utilization persist due to economic, geographic, and structural barriers. To better understand these trends, data from SAMHSA and the last 20 years of Google Trends API data will be analyzed to identify correlations between mental health awareness and search trends. 
By aggregating these trends, the goal is to improve state-level mental health forecasting and provide insights into the key factors influencing mental health service utilization.

Hypothesis:

States with higher Google Trends search interest for mental health-related terms and poorer socioeconomic indicators (e.g., low income, high unemployment) will show higher utilization rates for mental health services in the following year.

Prediction:

A machine learning model trained on past trends and demographic indicators will predict 2024 utilization rates with an RMSE under 5 points and an R-squared above 0.75 for at least 70% of states. This project builds upon an existing study conducted by the student's research team that explored predictive modeling of mental health service utilization using Google Trends data. Their preliminary findings demonstrated promising results but require methodological enhancements to improve model robustness, predictive accuracy, and interpretability. This project aims to develop a more robust and accurate predictive model by refining feature engineering, optimizing machine learning methodologies, and enhancing hyperparameter tuning techniques. The insights gained from this project could contribute to an original research paper, positioning the work for academic publication.
